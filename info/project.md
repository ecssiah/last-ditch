# Overview

Last Ditch is a Civilization Garden.

The Judge issues a Rule that is then observed by Agents who act based on their perception of the Rule. Their perception of the Rule is based on their personal Traits.

## Principles

1. _Actions must be observed_
   Agents do not immediately become aware of actions taken by the Judge. There must be some form of observation involved.
2. _Agents always respond based on their Traits_
   An Agent will respond to an observed Rule based on their Traits, leading them to sometimes ignore, support, or subvert a Rule.
