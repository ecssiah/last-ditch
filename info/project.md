# Overview
Last Ditch is a Civilizational Garden. 

A user-controlled Agent interacts with the simulated world by defining Laws that govern the behavior of the other Agents. Each Agent has its own characteristics and will that may conflict
or align with the Laws, resulting in variation in the evolution of the Garden.

## Principles
1. *No action is immediately observable by all agents.*  
    The agents need to interact with a source of information in the world to become aware of the alteration. This means an agent needs to be motivated in some way to become aware of the source. In other words, an agent can have its own reason for acquiring the information, or the agent needs to be me made aware by other agents that enforce the information.
